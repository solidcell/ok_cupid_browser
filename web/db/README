okcupid.db is a SQLite file necessary for the application to run.
If you don't see it in here, pelase read the main read ... or run 
from the web directory:

>> bundle exec ruby lib/database.rb setup

you should now have an okcupid.db file generated and migrations run on it.

If you want to store your DB in Git, or wherever, then you should fork the project
and create a private repo & change the .gitignore file.
